# Operations: runtime environment variables

Pipeline-orchestrator reads runtime connection settings such as
`REDIS_URL` and auth-directory paths from the environment. Recovery no
longer has rollout flags: daemon startup always reconstructs queue state
from structured `tasks/PR-*.md` headers.

## Recovery from ERROR

When a task ships its terminal failure state to ERROR (frontmatter
status:ERROR), the operator has two recovery affordances:

1. **Retry button** — clears the cancellation_cause record + frontmatter
   status, daemon re-dispatches the spec from the top on the next IDLE
   cycle. Retry counter capped at 3 attempts in Redis (resets on file
   content change).

2. **Re-upload spec with changed content** — file content hash differs
   from stored hash → daemon treats as fresh task, cancellation_cause
   cleared, retry counter reset.

Both affordances are mutually exclusive: Retry is for unchanged content
("try again, environment may have transient issue"); re-upload is for
changed content ("operator iterated on the spec itself").
